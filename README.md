# React + Appwrite Practice Project

This is a practice project built using **React.js** and **Appwrite**. The goal of this project is to enhance and solidify my frontend development skills, particularly in working with modern tools like React and backend-as-a-service platforms like Appwrite.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React.js** – Frontend library for building UI components
- **Appwrite** – Backend-as-a-Service for authentication, database, storage, etc.
- **JavaScript** – Programming language
- **Vite** – Fast development build tool

## 🛠️ Features

- User Authentication (using Appwrite)
- Dynamic UI with reusable React components
- Clean folder structure for scalability
- Responsive design (WIP)

## 📌 Note

This project is still a **work in progress**, and I’ll be updating this repository regularly with new features, improvements, and clean code practices as I continue to learn and grow as a frontend developer.

## 📅 Purpose

This project serves purely for **practice and learning purposes** as I sharpen my React and modern frontend skills.
